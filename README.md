Project Title: Ruby on Rails Job Search Application

1. Project Overview:



Develop a Ruby on Rails application that enables users to search for job openings based on personalized story-based queries. The application should provide email verification for new user registration and allow users to save job requisitions of interest. Job postings will be sourced from Indeed.com. The application will be deployed on AWS and Heroku.



2. Objectives:



- Allow users to register and log in to the application.



- Implement email verification for new user registration, where a unique link is sent to the user's email address.



- Enable users to search for job openings.



- Provide a basic bullet point list of general options for the user's desired career path.



- Show the actual job results pulled from the Indeed.com API.



- Allow users to save job requisitions for future reference.



- Implement a story-based search functionality using ChatGPT.



- Retrieve job postings from Indeed.com.



- Set up version control using Git and a repository on GitHub.



- Deploy the application on AWS and Heroku.
